#### How to run
1. Install ArangoDB database in your system
2. Use default port
3. Use root and 1234 as user and password
4. Import the code in your favourite IDE as maven project
5. Run the test file called RequirementTests ( the application creates the database if it does not exists...)

  - You can also run the CLI but it is an early stage, and things break
  - You can also run the other test files, but take into account that the order in which you run the functions matter, so some may throw errors

6. enjoy!
